    Create controllers for all selected nodes.

    Usage::

      1) Select transform node(s).

      2) Run 'create_world_controllers' tool, new world-space
         transform is created at same position as input transform
         nodes.

      3) New nodes are selected.

      4) User manipulates newly created nodes.

      5) Run 'remove_controllers' tool, selected transform nodes are
          deleted and animation is transfered back onto original
          nodes.

    This is to provide a simple tool to select many nodes and create
    (world-space) controllers for each node. The user may then do
    whatever is needed to transform and re-parent the controllers.
